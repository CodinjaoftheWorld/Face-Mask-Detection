# Face-Mask-Detection-from-Images-and-Video-feed

This repository is showing how to detect the masks on the live video stream using openCV.

The original model to detect mask on faces is trained using mobilenetV2 architecture. I am thankful to Adrian Rosebrock for his excellent blogs and tutorials on computer vision. I picked one of his tutorial on the face mask detection on images and video feed and just created an API using Flask.


I highly recommed to work on the below link for model training and mask detections for Images and Video Feed.

Part 1: Detect the Face Mask from Video Feed

Setps:
  1. Clone the repository, go to directory ‘Detect from video stream’ and run app.py file.

  2. Go to http://0.0.0.0:5000/. Grab your mask to check the detection.


Alert: Follow the link and get tesoflow installed in your CPU ot GPU. Please create the virtual environment and always run the codes in venv.
